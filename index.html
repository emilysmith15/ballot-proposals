<div class="story">
    <p>When New Yorkers go to the polls on Nov. 4, they will be met with six ballot proposals, three of which would change power structures concerning New York City’s highly consequential Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP).</p>

        <li>Amendment to Allow Olympic Sports Complex in Essex County on State Forest Preserve Land</li>
        <p>A <a href="https://www.nycvotes.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2025-general-election/2025-ballot-proposals/ballot-proposal-1/"target="blank">"yes"</a> vote would allow for expanded skiing and related trail facilities on a site of 1,039 acres in the Adirondack forest preserve.</p> 
        <p>The Adirondack Park hosts the Olympic Sports Complex, where this proposal aims to expand trail facilities while compensating for the lost public land by adding 2,500 acres of new protected land.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.nycvotes.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2025-general-election/2025-ballot-proposals/ballot-proposal-2/"target="blank">first option</a> would be available to Housing Development Fund Companies (HDFCs) – responsible for practically all publicly financed 100% affordable housing projects in NYC – and would allow the Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA) to approve projects review from  the local Community Board, who could offer recommendations. </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/charter/downloads/pdf/2025/7-21-2025-charter-revision-commission-adopted-final-report-digital.pdf"target="blank">second option</a> would create “a new public review procedure for applications that deliver affordable housing in the community districts that permit the least affordable housing” under the City’s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) program. The City Planning Commission (CPC) would make the final decision after recommendations from the local Community Board.</p>

    <p>This proposal would create an Expedited Land Use Review Procedure (ELURP) for <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/charter/downloads/pdf/2025/7-21-2025-charter-revision-commission-adopted-final-report-digital.pdf"target="blank">projects</a> that “categorically lack potential significant adverse impacts on communities.” The final decision for these projects would lie with the CPC.</p>

        <p>The Department of City Planning would be responsible for creating, maintaining, and digitizing a single map, instead of the current system in which five topographical bureaus across the Borough Presidents’ offices are responsible.</p>

        <p>Current city elections happen on odd numbered years while federal presidential elections are on even numbered years. This would affect the city offices of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and city council. </p>
